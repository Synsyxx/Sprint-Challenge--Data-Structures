## What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
1. Stack - Stack follows the Last In First Out method (LIFO), where the last item placed in the structure will be the first one out.

2. Queue - Queue follows the First In First Out method (FIFO), where the first item placed in the structure will be the first one out.




## What is the retrieval time complexity for the following data structures?
1. Linked List - Time Complexity of linked lists is O(n);
2. Hash Table - Time Complexity of hash tables is O(1);
3. Binary Search Trees - Best Case O(1), worst case O(n);




## What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

## The primary advantage of a Hash Table is that it always takes constant time to find a spot for a key and put a value there. It also takes constant time in order to retrieve a value. Arrays on the other hand, unless you know the index position of the item you are searching for, take longer, in that you have to scan through the entire list of items in your array in order to find the item.
